# ReadME Generator

## Description

The ReadME generator allows developers to input data about sections of their desired ReadME and outputs a completed ReadME. This solves the problem of making a ReadME for a certain project. I learned about inquirer and writeFile because I used it to prompt the questions in the console and make the ReadME.  

## Installation

To install the readme generator, first ensure that you have installed inquirer using the "npm install -y". This will install the default node modules needed for inquirer. Next, in the command line enter "node index.js". You will be prompted with the questions about the sections of the ReadME.

## Usage

To use, enter "node index.js" into the integrated console. Answer the questions as they are prompted; the license section will have a list of options to chose from.
